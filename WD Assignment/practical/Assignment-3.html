    Hawa Mahal, or the "Palace of Winds," is a famous monument in Jaipur, Rajasthan, built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai
    Pratap Singh. Made of red and pink sandstone, it features a five-story façade with 953 small windows (jharokhas)
    designed to let cool air flow through and allow royal women to view street life without being seen. The palace
    reflects a blend of Rajput and Mughal architectural styles and resembles a honeycomb or crown. Though grand from the
    outside, its interior is narrow and simple. Hawa Mahal remains one of Jaipur’s most iconic and visited historical
    landmarks
