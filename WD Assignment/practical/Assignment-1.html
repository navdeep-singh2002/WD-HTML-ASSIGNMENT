  <h1>Be Strong </h1>
  <p>Being strong doesn't only mean having physical strength, it means having the courage to face challenges, the patience to grow, and the mindset to keep going even when times are tough. Every day gives us a new chance to improve, to learn, and to become better than yesterday. True strength is built through hard work, dedication, and belief in oneself. When you fall, don’t give up. Stand up stronger. Strength is not about never failing, it's about rising every time you fail. Stay strong, stay focused, and keep moving forward toward your goals.</p>
